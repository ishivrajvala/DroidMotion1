# Motion Layout for Modern Android UI transitions

MotionLayout is a layout type that helps you manage motion and widget animation in your app. MotionLayout is a subclass of ConstraintLayout and builds upon its rich layout capabilities. As part of the ConstraintLayout library, MotionLayout is available as a support library and is backwards-compatible to API level 14.

So here we started

Add the ConstraintLayout dependency: To use MotionLayout in your project, add the ConstraintLayout 2.0 dependency to your app's build.gradle file. If you're using AndroidX, add the following dependency:

dependencies {
  implementation("androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.0.0-beta1")
}
